[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/impin2rex)

This is a simple Google login system.
NodeJS-powered API.

- Put your project's CLIENT_ID on server.js & views/login.ejs
- Now you're good to go!

## Features

- Get basic details of user. Here is the reference docs https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in

## Used

google_auth_login uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [node.js] - Run the backend.
- [Express JS] - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.js
- [cookie-parser] - Parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names. Optionally you may enable signed cookie support by passing a secret string, which assigns req.secret so it may be used by other middleware.
- [google-auth-library] - This is Google's officially supported node.js client library for using OAuth 2.0 authorization and authentication with Google APIs.
- [ejs] - EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things.
- [nodemon] - nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
